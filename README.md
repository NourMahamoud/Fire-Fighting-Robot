# Fire-Fighting-Robot
A simple and effective fire-fighting robot designed to detect and extinguish small fires automatically.

🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a fire-fighting robot built using basic sensors and a motor-control system.
The robot detects flame sources, moves toward them, and activates a water pump to extinguish the fire.

✨ Features

🔍 Flame Detection using IR/Flame sensors

🚗 Autonomous Movement with motor driver (L298N)

💦 Automatic Extinguishing System using a pump and servo

⚡ Real-time Decision Making

🔋 Powered by simple battery setup

🛠 Hardware Used

Arduino

L298N Motor Driver

DC Motors

Flame / IR Sensors

Water Pump

Servo Motor

Battery Pack

📌 How It Works

The sensors continuously scan for fire.

When a flame is detected, the robot rotates toward its direction.

It moves forward until reaching the fire source.

The pump activates to extinguish the flame automatically.

🎯 Purpose

This project aims to provide a simple, low-cost, and safe first-response solution for small indoor fires and to demonstrate practical applications of robotics and embedded systems.
